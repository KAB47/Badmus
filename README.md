Passionate about coding and technology, my skills in Python, C#, .NET, Azure, React, and data engineering align with the job description. I want to use this role to bring a commitment to ownership, seeing projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles, collaborate and work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds, and trust others to effectively handle time, and priorities, and support others while having the space to think for myself. I aim to build a successful career in software development.


Experience coding in programming languages: Completed diverse software development courses in Python, C#, Azure, React, and ASP.NET/.NET. Applied expertise in data structures, storage systems, front-end frameworks and various projects, including physics-focused Unity Engine game, website, ASP.Net API, and database design. Gained proficiency in debugging, C# and Python fundamentals, and advanced concepts like LINQ, inheritance, and interfaces.
I have completed a course using Meta React, creating a website with JavaScript. Used stage-management and multi-page navigation. Courses in Azure provided knowledge in cloud infrastructure, storage systems, VPN Gateway, database services, state management, event handling, and conditional rendering. I am dedicated to a software development career and I am a continuous learner, wanting to develop my skills.

Engineering background: In a software engineering internship, I utilised a high-resolution camera to identify deformation changes across a material’s surface. I developed a C/C++ program to quantify and analyse datasets, effectively determining the force and displacement necessary for material damage.
In another software internship, I improved manufacturing efficiency with a wireless 3D file system using Python and a Raspberry Pi, stopping the need for manual slow travel walking, reducing production time.
Within my MSc I planned the Enceladus Orbilander spacecraft mission, creating secure Python code for dataset handling and utilising the YOLO algorithm and TensorFlow for image detection.

Communication (Oral/Written) Skills: As a university’s engineering department administrator, I coordinated online communication and collaborated with a variety of individuals, including engineers, users and non-technical team members for the fastest human-powered bicycle project. Managed emails, social media, and collaborated with the project team, sponsors, and stakeholders. I organised meetings and promoted cooperation in a dynamic environment.
In a cross-functional/multicultural team, I effectively communicated to a remote team, ensuring alignment with project objectives. This experience has instilled confidence in making decisions independently, the ability to ask questions when stuck, and comfort in working independently and remotely.
